* Main faunctionality of this app is configured to display randomly selected quotes by the user interection via "Show another quote" button
* When the page is initially loaded, app automatically starts (called Auto Init) displaying randomly selected quotes in every two seconds
* Auto Init session ends with user's intereaction via "Show another quote" button
* During the auto init session main background of the app will switch with the randomly selected colors and when it ends it returns the original color
* When user intereacted with the button, app starts displaying randomly selected quotes upon per click
* It's aimed not to get two same quotes in a row during the random selection. Meaning that user will never see two same quotes in a row.
